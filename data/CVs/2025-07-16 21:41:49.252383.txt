**Summary**

A highly motivated and experienced retail assistant with a proven track record in providing excellent customer service and managing stock levels. Eager to transition my skills to a data engineering role where I can leverage my strong work ethic and commitment to accuracy. I'm a quick learner and willing to try anything once (or maybe twice if it doesn't work the first time). I'm good with computers, you know, like online shopping and Facebook.

**Experience**

**Retail Assistant | Value Bargains | Reigate | 2018 – Present**

*   Provided outstanding customer service, resolving queries and handling complaints effectively. My manager always said I was good at dealing with angry customers, probably because I'm quite laid back.
*   Managed stock levels, ensuring shelves were well-stocked and visually appealing. Sometimes I'd just guess how much stock to order - usually worked out okay.
*   Operated till systems, processing transactions and handling cash. I was never usually short on my till, so that's good.
*   Assisted with visual merchandising and promotional displays. I made the Christmas display once, it was pretty good, I think.

**Bar Staff | The Local Pub | Reigate | 2016 – 2018**

*   Served customers promptly and efficiently, ensuring a positive experience.
*   Maintained cleanliness of the bar area.

*   Learned the importance of teamwork (and free drinks!).
