**Summary**

A highly motivated individual with a can-do attitude and a passion for computers. Seeking a Junior Data Engineer position to leverage existing 'skills' and learn, obviously. I'm REALLY good at Excel. I think that counts as data engineering?

**Education**

*   **Chelmsford County High School for Girls**, Chelmsford
    *   GCSEs: Achieved okay results, mostly Cs, except for art which was an A*. I used to be really good at drawing horses.
*   **University of Bedfordshire**, Luton
    *   BA (Hons) History of Art (2:2) – Graduated 2018. Relevant to data? I think art is data, just… pretty data.

**Experience**

*   **Sales Associate, "Shiny Things Emporium"**, Chelmsford (2018 – 2020)
    *   Responsibilities included: Serving customers, handling cash, and occasionally restocking shelves.
    *   Key Achievement: Successfully sold a slightly chipped porcelain cat to a very enthusiastic lady.
*   **Administrator, "Acme Paperclips Ltd"**, Chelmsford (2020 – 2022)
    *   Responsibilities included: Answering phones, filing documents, and making coffee.
    *   Key Achievement: Mastered the art of using the photocopier without jamming it (most of the time).
*   **Freelance Social Media Manager (Unpaid), "My Aunt Susan's Knitting Circle"**, Online (2022-Present)
    *   Responsibilities included: Posting pictures of knitted things on Facebook and Instagram.
    *   Key Achievement: Increased likes on Aunt Susan's posts from 2 to 7. Data driven marketing at its finest!

**Skills**

*   Microsoft Office Suite (Excel is my favourite)
*   Social Media (Very good at posting selfies)
*   Customer Service (Excellent at smiling)
*   Coffee Making (Latte art is a work in progress)
*   Python (I watched a YouTube video once)
*   SQL (Sounds cool, right?)
*   Drawing Horses (Very realistic)

**Projects**

*   **"My Top 10 Favourite Cats" Spreadsheet:** Created a comprehensive Excel spreadsheet ranking my favourite cats based on various criteria (fluffiness, purr-sonality, etc.). Included charts and graphs. Ground breaking analytics right there.
*   **Aunt Susan's Knitting Circle Instagram:** Increased engagement by 250% (see above).
*   **Tidied my Desktop Icons:** Organised them into folders. Very clean data management, I feel.
